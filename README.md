# this is the repo for all my 3D projects.

Because of the way that eclipse stored my data, you get to see all of my assignments for the course.

The two major applications are assignment 2 and 3.

Assignment 2 is a 3D wireframe application which I designed from scratch (I didnt realise the lecturer had better startup code online so you might see some funny things happening)

Assignment 3 is a 3D texture mapping application. I had to create lighting and perspective to turn 2D planes and circles into 3D objects
